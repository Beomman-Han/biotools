    Gene's characteristics
    - It locates across specific region in genome (= it has DNA sequence)
    - It has 'exons' and 'introns' -> all possible transcripts???
    - It goes through 'splicing' -> motif for splicing
    - It has 'promotor' at the upstream location
    - It could be transcripted
    - It could be multiple transcript
